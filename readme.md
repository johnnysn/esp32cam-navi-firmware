# Esp32-CAM NAVI Firmware

Esp32 Firmware for video streaming, servo control and robot navigation. 
This project was based on Espressif's [CameraWebServer](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/ESP32/examples/Camera/CameraWebServer) example.

## index.html page

The source code of the project's UI page must be placed in the **index_html_content.h**. I have a separate project for generating this page, which can be found [here](https://github.com/johnnysn/esp32cam-navi-ui).
